# Spartacus Incubator

Spartacus Incubator is a package that include features still in development. The features included in the library can be used but are likelly to evolve in future releases and might even get refactored over time. The incubator package might contain core and storefront related code.

Once a feature from the incubator library is ready for final release, it will get moved to the correct other Spartacus library.

Each version of the incubator library has hard dependendies on an exact version of the other Spartacus libraries.
